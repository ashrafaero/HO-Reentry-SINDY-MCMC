# HO-Reentry-SINDY-MCMC
A reduced-order model based on the High-Order approach to reconstruct the trajectory of the 1-DOF atmospheric entry vehicle and estimate the aerodynamic coefficients and their uncertainties. SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) and MCMC-NUTS algorithms will be utilized.
